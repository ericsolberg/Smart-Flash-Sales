==========LLM call for step "extractAppSkeleton":==========
You help the user building a Fiori Elements application described in the user input.

The application typically starts with a ListReport page showing the data of the base entity of the application in a table.
Details of a specific table row are shown in the ObjectPage. This first ObjectPage is therefore based on the base entity of the application.
An ObjectPage can contain one or more table sections based on to-many associations of its entity type.
The details of a table section row can be shown in an another ObjectPage based on the associations target entity.

Your task is to find the entities (with their associations) as well as the ObjectPages (with the associations they use in table sections) described in the user input below.

You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

Create a SAP Fiori application based on the requirements outlined in the following user story: User Story Description
As a retail grocery store manager, I want to create and manage sale events that are called flash sales. The application should include the following entities.
The Flash Sale entity generally has the following attributes:
1.	Start date and time
2.	Duration Hours (a decimal number)
3.	Title
4.	Description
5.	Status which can include “New”, “Pending Approval”, “Ready”, “Running”, “Completed”, “Rejected”, and “Canceled”
6.	A one-to-many composition of Sale Product
The Sale Product entity maintains a list of grocery products that are part of the sale. The Sale Product entity generally has the following attributes:
1.	Sale price
2.	Product ID
The Product entity maintains the master list of grocery products. The Product entity generally contains the following attributes:
1.	Product ID
2.	Product Name
3.	Regular price
4.	Shelf Location (a string specifying the physical location of the shelf space)
5.	ESL Device (a string specifying the hardware address of the shelf label)
Acceptance Criteria
Scenario 1: List All Flash Sales
Given I am logged into the Flash Sale management system, when I launch the SAP Fiori application to maintain flash shales, I should be able to view the list of all the Flash Sale entities in a list without pressing the GO button. The list should be grouped into sections based on the status. The list of all the flash sales should have: start date and time, duration, title, status, default discount, and number of Sale Products. The list of filters should include status and start date.
Scenario 2:
Given I am logged into the Flash Sale management system, when I select a specific flash sale from the list of the SAP Fiori application, then I should be able to view the flash sale details.

The DataModel consists of the following entities and associations:

==========LLM call for step "extractListReport":==========
A Fiori Elements Application has the following pages:
 - ListReport page for "FlashSales"
 - ObjectPage for "FlashSales"

Available entities with their associations and elements are:
Entity "FlashSales"
   Properties:
       startDateAndTime: The start date and time of the flash sale
       durationHours: The duration of the flash sale in hours
       title: The title of the flash sale
       description: The description of the flash sale
       status: The status of the flash sale. Allowed values: New, Pending Approval, Ready, Running, Completed, Rejected, Canceled
   Associations:
       saleProducts: association to entity SaleProducts
Entity "SaleProducts"
   Properties:
       salePrice: The sale price of the product
   Associations:
       product: association to entity Products
       flashSales: association to entity FlashSales
Entity "Products"
   Properties:
       productID: The ID of the product

       regularPrice: The regular price of the product
       shelfLocation: The physical location of the shelf space
       eslDevice: The hardware address of the shelf label

The user input below describes the details of the ListReport page (i.e. its filters, tables or views with their columns).

Your task is to help the user defining the ListReport page.
You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

For example, the example "JSON Schema" instance {{"properties": {{"foo": {{"description": "a list of test words", "type": "array", "items": {{"type": "string"}}}}}}, "required": ["foo"]}}
would match an object with one required property, "foo". The "type" property specifies "foo" must be an "array", and the "description" property semantically describes it as "a list of test words". The items within "foo" must be strings.
Thus, the object {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}} is a well-formatted instance of this example "JSON Schema". The object {{"properties": {{"foo": ["bar", "baz"]}}}} is not well-formatted.

Your output will be parsed and type-checked according to the provided schema instance, so make sure all fields in your output match the schema exactly and there are no trailing commas!

Here is the JSON Schema instance your output must adhere to. Include the enclosing markdown codeblock:
```json

==========LLM call for step "extractColors":==========
You help the user creating a Fiori Elements application based on user input describing such an application.
Your task is to determine whether the entity properties can be considered good and bad in most contexts or are usually neutral. When in doubt, set to neutral.

These are the entity properties and their values:
Entity: FlashSales, Property: status, Values: New, Pending Approval, Ready, Running, Completed, Rejected, Canceled

If the properties can be considered good and bad, the allowed values for their criticality and the associated colors are:
   negative: red
   critical: yellow or orange
   positive: green
   neutral:  grey
You must format your output as a JSON value that adheres to a given "JSON Schema" instance.

"JSON Schema" is a declarative language that allows you to annotate and validate JSON documents.

==========LLM call for data generation:==========

For the following list of entities, create data for the empty CSV files.
Entity "FlashSales" - Properties:
    startDateAndTime: DateTime, The start date and time of the flash sale
    durationHours: Decimal, The duration of the flash sale in hours
    title: String(50), The title of the flash sale
    description: String, The description of the flash sale
    status: String(20), The status of the flash sale. Allowed values: New, Pending Approval, Ready, Running, Completed, Rejected, Canceled

Entity "SaleProducts" - Properties:
    salePrice: Decimal, The sale price of the product
    product_productID: String(50), productID of associated Products
    flashSales_startDateAndTime: DateTime, startDateAndTime of associated FlashSales

Entity "Products" - Properties:
    productID: String(50), The ID of the product
    productName: String(50), The name of the product
    regularPrice: Decimal, The regular price of the product
    shelfLocation: String, The physical location of the shelf space
    eslDevice: String, The hardware address of the shelf label

Empty CSV files in json format (only generate content for these files!):
{"FlashSales.csv":"startDateAndTime;durationHours;title;description;status","SaleProducts.csv":"salePrice;product_productID;flashSales_startDateAndTime","Products.csv":"productID;productName;regularPrice;shelfLocation;eslDevice"}

Rules:
    - Take over the given header line, do not invent new columns!
    - For a given file, add rows, add '\n' characters before each row but don't break the JSON string
    - Do not generate rows with same key values, they must be unique!
    - Make sure that associations match, i.e. a field containing "Name of the associated Customer" must contain an existing Name of entity Customer
    - Always use ";" as a delimiter in CSV files
    - The result must be proper JSON format so it can be parsed, don't break JSON strings within, don't add quotes around values.
    - Create about 5 rows for the first csv, 7 for the second and so on
    - All values must be realistic with meaningful content, e.g. 'Laptop Screen' and not just placeholder values with incremented numbers like 'Product 1', 'Product 2' etc.
    
Use format for values:
  DateTime: 2021-06-27T14:52:23Z
  Decimal(3,2): 1.23
  String(50): string no longer than 50 characters
    
For the following fields, use only the supplied allowed values (as they are, don't insert spaces or change case):
- status (of FlashSales): New, PendingApproval, Ready, Running, Completed, Rejected, Canceled

Example output (Do NOT include in output!):
```json
