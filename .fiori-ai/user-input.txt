Acceptance Criteria
Scenario 1: List All Flash Sales
Given I am logged into the Flash Sale management system, when I launch the SAP Fiori application to maintain flash shales, I should be able to view the list of all the Flash Sale entities in a list without pressing the GO button. The list should be grouped into sections based on the status. The list of all the flash sales should have: start date and time, duration, title, status, default discount, and number of Sale Products. The list of filters should include status and start date.
Scenario 2:
Given I am logged into the Flash Sale management system, when I select a specific flash sale from the list of the SAP Fiori application, then I should be able to view the flash sale details.
